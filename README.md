# Agentic Hackathon - North Star AGI

## Project Overview
**Agentic_Hackathon_North_Star_AGI** is an advanced AI-driven system designed to showcase autonomous problem-solving capabilities in dynamic environments. Created by **Angelo and Yorbe**, this project aims to push the boundaries of artificial general intelligence (AGI) through agentic interactions, real-time decision-making, and adaptive learning.

## Features
- **Autonomous Decision Making** – Implements AI agents that analyze, reason, and execute actions independently.
- **Real-Time Adaptability** – Continuously learns and refines decision-making based on new data.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – Supports interactions between AI agents for problem-solving.
- **Security & Ethical AI** – Includes safeguards to ensure responsible AI behavior.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/Agentic_Hackathon_North_Star_AGI.git
   cd Agentic_Hackathon_North_Star_AGI
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Modify `config.json` to adjust parameters for agent behaviors.
- Use `agent_interface.py` to interact with the AI agents.
- Log results and insights in `logs/` for analysis.
